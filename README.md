# Cylindrical Magnet B-Field Solution

## About
This code calculates the B-field of a cylindrical magnet at any point in 3D space given magnetization, radius, and height.

I use a bound-current approximation, discretized into rings. I discretize these rings into arcs, and solve for the B-field at any given point using Biot-Savart and the superposition principle.
